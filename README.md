# css-practice-and-project
A collection of my CSS practice files and mini-projects. This repository includes simple to advanced CSS examples where I experiment with layouts, animations, flexbox, grid, gradients, and real-world UI designs. I’m using this repo to improve my CSS fundamentals and build a strong foundation for frontend development.
